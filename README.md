## Hello, I'm Angela 👋



I'm a [Statistics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate-taught/statistics/) student at Imperial College London. I'm building more theoretical grounds of **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**. I love using statistical and programming toolkits to solve real-word problems and innovate the old statistical methodology where it is necessary. I previously studied biostatistics and worked as an applied statistician for the Breast Cancer Surgery Team at Cornell University.
